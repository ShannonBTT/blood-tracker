1. Project Overview
Project Title: BloodTracker

Purpose:
The BloodTracker web application is designed to help Shanon—diagnosed with cancer—track her blood test results over time. The app provides an intuitive, multi-step data entry process, a dashboard for reviewing past tests, and PDF generation for sharing with healthcare providers. An emphasis is placed on a modern, accessible design using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components, ensuring a consistent and polished experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Scope:

Develop a multi-step form for blood test data entry.
Implement user registration, secure login, and data storage using Supabase.
Provide dark mode and white mode themes for improved accessibility.
Include PDF generation for individual blood test records.
Ensure a responsive UI/UX design across mobile, tablet, and desktop platforms.
Use Shadcn UI combined with Tailwind CSS for rapid development, customizability, and accessibility.

2. Functional Requirements

2.1 User Authentication and Authorization
User Registration/Login:
Allow user sign-up with email and password.
Secure authentication via Supabase.
Password recovery and reset functionality.
Access Control:
Only authenticated users can view, modify, or delete their blood test records.
Implement secure session management with appropriate timeouts.

2.2 Multi-Step Blood Test Form
Form Structure:
A multi-step process (e.g., Step 1, Step 2, etc.) to simplify data entry.
Each step focuses on a specific group of inputs (personal details, test parameters, notes, and review).
Form Fields:
Checkboxes: For various test markers and symptoms.
Date Inputs: For recording the test date (and time if needed).
Additional Inputs: Numeric fields, text areas, and dropdowns as required.
Navigation and Validation:
“Next” and “Back” buttons to navigate between steps.
Validate required fields at each step.
Include a progress indicator that shows the current step out of the total.
Submission:
A “Save Blood Test” button on the final step saves the record to the database.

2.3 Blood Test Listing and Management
Record Dashboard:
Display a dashboard listing all blood tests with corresponding dates.
Enable sorting (e.g., by date) and filtering options.
Record Details and Editing:
Allow users to click on a test record to view detailed information.
Provide editing options with validations in place.

2.4 PDF Generation
Export Functionality:
Offer a “Generate PDF” button on the test detail view.
Generated PDF reports must include all test data in a clear, formatted layout.
Ensure PDFs are mobile-friendly when viewed on various devices.

2.5 Data Storage and Integration with Supabase
Backend Integration:
Use Supabase for all CRUD operations related to users and blood test records.
Secure storage of user profiles and test data.
Security Measures:
Encrypt sensitive data.
Use HTTPS for all data transmissions.
Adhere to data protection regulations and best practices.

3. UI/UX Design and Component Strategy
3.1 Design Goals
Simplicity and Accessibility:
The app must be easy to use, with an uncluttered interface and clear navigation. Given the sensitive nature of the data, the design should minimize stress and cognitive load.
Consistency:
All UI components (forms, buttons, navigation menus) should follow a consistent design language.
Responsiveness:
The interface must be fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices to ensure a seamless experience on any screen size.

3.2 UI/UX Implementation Approach
Tailwind CSS:
Utilize Tailwind CSS for its utility-first approach, offering precise control over design details while building a custom, modern interface.
Shadcn UI:
Leverage Shadcn UI—a component library built on top of Tailwind CSS and Radix UI—for pre-built, accessible components. Key benefits include:
Rapid Development: Pre-designed components reduce development time.
Customizability: Components are integrated directly into the codebase, allowing for easy customization.
Accessibility: Built-in accessibility features ensure components meet best practices.
Mobile and Tablet Responsiveness:
All layouts and components must adapt to varying screen sizes.
Utilize Tailwind CSS responsive utilities (e.g., breakpoint classes) to adjust margins, padding, font sizes, and component arrangements for mobile and tablet views.
Test the interface on multiple devices and orientations to ensure optimal usability.
Recommendation:
For the BloodTracker project, combining Shadcn UI with Tailwind CSS is recommended. This solution not only speeds up development and ensures design consistency but also provides a high degree of customizability while delivering a fully responsive experience

3.3 Theming (Dark Mode / White Mode)
Theme Toggle:
Implement an easily accessible toggle switch to switch between dark and white modes.
Component Adaptability:
Ensure all UI components respond correctly to theme changes.
Utilize Tailwind CSS theming and custom configuration to manage color palettes dynamically.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
4.1 Performance
The application should load quickly on all devices, including mobile phones and tablets.
Optimize API calls to Supabase to minimize latency and improve responsiveness.

4.2 Usability and Accessibility
User Interface:
A clean, minimalistic design that is intuitive for all users.
Responsive layouts for seamless use on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
Accessibility:
Meet WCAG guidelines to support users with disabilities.
Ensure accessible navigation, form controls, and interactive elements across all devices.

4.3 Reliability and Scalability
The application must be robust and capable of handling intermittent connectivity issues.
The architecture should be scalable to support future enhancements and a growing user base.

4.4 Security
Authentication & Authorization:
Secure user authentication and session management via Supabase.
Data Protection:
Implement encryption and secure data transmission (HTTPS).
User Privacy:
Adhere to data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR if applicable).

4.5 Maintainability
Utilize Vite with React to enable fast builds and an efficient development workflow.
Write modular, well-documented code with unit/integration tests where appropriate.

5. System Architecture & Technology Stack
5.1 Frontend
Framework: React, built using Vite.
State Management: Use React Context API or a state management library (e.g., Redux) as needed.
Routing: Implement routing (e.g., React Router) for navigation between login, dashboard, form entry, and detailed views.
Responsive Design:
Ensure all components are built with responsiveness in mind using Tailwind CSS responsive utilities.

5.2 Backend & Data Storage
Backend-as-a-Service: Use Supabase for user authentication, database management, and secure API endpoints.
Database Schema:
Users Table: For storing user credentials and profile information.
BloodTests Table: For recording blood test entries, including dates, checkboxes, and additional inputs.
Audit/History (Optional): For tracking changes to ensure data integrity.

5.3 PDF Generation
Library: Integrate a JavaScript PDF generation library (e.g., jsPDF or PDFMake) for producing downloadable reports.
UI Integration:
Embed PDF generation options within the test detail view, ensuring that generated PDFs are also mobile-friendly.

5.4 Deployment
Hosting: Deploy the application on a reliable cloud provider or a static site hosting service.
CI/CD: Set up automated continuous integration and deployment pipelines to streamline updates.
